# Java Algorithms Challenge: Implementations and Testing with Maven

## About the Project

This repository is the central hub for the Java Algorithms Challenge, a project designed to boost your proficiency in Java programming, your fluency with Git and GitHub, and your experience with Maven and JUnit. By engaging in algorithmic challenges and contributing solutions, participants will be well-prepared for more complex projects, especially those involving Spring Boot.

## Objectives

- Utilize Git and GitHub in a real-world project setting.
- Enhance Java programming skills using Java 17.
- Gain familiarity with Maven project management.
- Write and execute unit tests using JUnit framework.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Project**: Start by forking the repository to obtain your copy of the project.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine to begin working on it.
3. **Select an Issue**: Pick an issue you want to contribute a solution to.
4. **Create a New Branch**: For each issue, create a specific branch for your work.

## Contributing

### Steps for Contribution

1. **Implement the Solution**: Write the necessary code to resolve the chosen issue.
2. **Write Unit Tests**: Ensure you include unit tests for your code following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.
3. **Document Your Code**: Comment your code to clarify your logic and design choices.
4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Once your solution is ready and tested, create a PR to merge it into the main repository.

### Submission Guidelines

- **Branch Naming**: Use the format `feature/#IssueNumber-description` for your branches.
- **PR Description**: Provide a clear and concise description of your changes when submitting a PR.

## Rules and Etiquette

- Each participant must submit at least one PR and review at least one PR from another contributor.
- Promote a positive and respectful learning environment. Constructive criticism is encouraged, but always with kindness and respect.

## Project Structure

For every issue addressed, there should be:
- A single test file within the `fr.afrogeek.algorithms` package in the `test` directory.
- One implementation file within the `fr.afrogeek.algorithms` package in the `main` directory.

This structure maintains project organization and ensures that all contributions follow a consistent format.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**: The latest version of Java at the time of this project.
- **Maven**: For project management and build automation.
- **JUnit**: The framework used for unit testing our solutions.
